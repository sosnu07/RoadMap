1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,000
How does the internet work?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The video you are watching now

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,500
traveled thousands of miles from a Google Data Center to reach
you.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:21,029
Let's learn how the internet works by getting to understand the details of
this data's incredible journey.

5
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,380
The data center which can be thousands of miles away from you has your video stored inside it.

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:32,278
how does this data reach your mobile phone or a laptop?

7
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,120
An easy way to achieve this goal would be with use of satellites.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,199
From the data center, a signal could be
sent to the satellite via an antenna,

9
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,309
and then from the satellite a signal
could be sent to your mobile phone

10
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:48,699
via another antenna near to you.

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,700
However, this way of transmitting signals is not a good idea.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's see why.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The satellite is parked nearly 22,000 miles above the earth's equator,

14
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,320
so in order for the data transmission to be successful,

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,619
the data would have to travel a total distance of 44,000 miles.

16
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:10,970
Such a long distance of travel causes a
significant delay in receiving the signal.

17
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:16,190
More specifically it causes huge
latency which is unacceptable

18
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,300
for most internet applications

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,300
so if this video does not reach you via a satellite then

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,399
how does it actually get to you?

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
Well it is done with the help of a complicated

22
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:27,100
network of optical fiber cables,

23
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,100
which connect between the data center and your device.

24
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,560
Your phone could be connected to the
internet via cellular data or any Wi-Fi router,

25
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,600
but ultimately at some point your
phone will be connected

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,710
to this network of optical fiber cables

27
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,300
We saw at the beginning that the video
you are currently watching

28
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,600
is stored inside a data center.

29
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,110
To be more specific, it is stored in a
solid-state device within the data center.

30
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,490
This SSD acts as the internal memory of a server.

31
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,289
The server is simply a powerful computer
whose job is to provide you the video or

32
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:09,699
other stored content when you request it.

33
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,700
Now the challenge is how to transfer the data stored

34
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,769
in the data center specifically to your device via the

35
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,300
complex network of optical fiber cables.

36
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,300
Let's see how this is done.

37
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,000
Before proceeding further we should first
understand an important concept

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,200
which is the concept of an IP address.

39
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Every device that is connected to the Internet

40
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,599
whether it is a server a computer or a
mobile phone is identified uniquely by a

41
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,399
string of numbers known as an IP address.

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,400
You can consider the IP address similar

43
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:48,400
to your home address that is the address,
that uniquely identifies your home.

44
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,880
Any letter sent to you reaches you precisely because of your home address.

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,099
Similarly in the internet world an IP
address acts as a shipping address

46
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:03,299
through which all information reaches
its destination.

47
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,920
Your internet service provider will decide the IP address of your device and you are able to see what

48
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,530
IP address your ISP has given to your
mobile phone or laptop.

49
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,109
The server in the data center also has
an IP address.

50
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,080
The server stores a website so you can
access any website just by knowing the

51
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,730
server's IP address. However, it is
difficult for a person to remember so

52
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,299
many IP addresses.

53
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,300
So to solve this problem domain names like

54
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,400
youtube.com, facebook.com etc are used which correspond to IP addresses

55
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,000
which are easier for us to remember than the long sequence of numbers

56
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,690
Another thing to notice here is that a server has the capability of storing several websites

57
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,640
and if the server consists of multiple
websites all the websites cannot be

58
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,600
accessed with the server's IP address.

59
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
In such cases additional pieces of

60
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,810
information, host headers are used to
uniquely identify the website.

61
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,730
However, for the giant web sites like Facebook.com or YouTube.com the entire data

62
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:14,040
center infrastructure will be dedicated
to the storage of the particular website.

63
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,000
To access the internet we always use
domain names instead of the complex IP address numbers.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,200
From where does the internet get IP addresses corresponding to our domain name requests.

65
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:32,099
Well, for this purpose the internet uses a huge phone book known as DNS.

66
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,350
If you know a person's name, but don't know their telephone number

67
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,000
you can simply look it
up in a phone book.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,080
The DNS server provides the same service to the internet.

69
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,620
Your internet service provider or other organizations can manage the DNS server.

70
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's have a recap of the whole operation.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You enter the domain name,

72
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,910
the browser sends a request to the DNS
server to get the corresponding IP address.

73
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,480
After getting the IP address,

74
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,480
your browser simply forwards the request to the data center,

75
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,319
more specifically to the respective
server.

76
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:13,119
Once the server gets a request to access
a particular website the data flow starts.

77
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:18,009
The data is transferred in digital format via optical fiber cables,

78
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:21,500
more specifically in the form of light
pulses.

79
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
These light pulses sometimes have

80
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,789
to travel thousands of miles via the
optical fiber cable to reach their destination.

81
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:31,899
During their journey they often have to go through tough terrains

82
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,400
such as hilly areas or under the sea.

83
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
There are a few global companies who lay

84
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:41,000
and maintain these optical cable
networks.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,639
These visuals show how the laying of optical fiber cables is done with the help of a ship.

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,449
A plow is dropped deep into the sea from
the ship,

87
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:58,180
and this plow creates a trench on the
seabed and to which places the optical fiber cable.

88
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,880
In fact, this complex optical cable

89
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,159
network is the backbone of the Internet.

90
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,620
These optical fiber cables carrying the

91
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:12,560
light are stretched across the seabed to
your doorstep where they are connected to a router.

92
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,540
The router converts these light signals

93
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,480
to electrical signals.

94
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,880
An Ethernet cable is then used to

95
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,200
transmit the electrical signals to your
laptop.

96
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,380
However if you are accessing the Internet using cellular data,

97
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,260
from the optical cable the signal has to be sent to a cell tower

98
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,400
and from the cell tower the signal

99
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,760
reaches your cell phone in the form of
electromagnetic waves.

100
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,840
Since the Internet is a global network
it has become important to have an

101
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:51,200
organization to manage things like IP
address assignment, domain name registration etc

102
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,380
this is all managed by
an institution called ICANN located in the USA.

103
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,300
One amazing thing about the
internet is its efficiency in

104
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,640
transmitting data when compared with
cellular and landline communication technologies.

105
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,140
This video you are watching
from the Google Data Center is sent to

106
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,599
you in the form of a huge collection of
zeros and ones.

107
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,659
What makes the data transfer in the internet efficient is the way in which these zeros and ones

108
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,260
are chopped up into small chunks known
as packets and transmitted.

109
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,140
Let's assume these streams of zeros and ones are divided into different packets by the

110
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,330
server where each packet consists of six
bits.

111
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,859
Along with the bits of the video each
packet also consists of the sequence

112
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,020
number and the IP addresses of the
server and your phone.

113
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,140
With this information the packets are routed towards your phone.

114
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,599
It's not necessary that all packets are routed through the same path and each packet independently

115
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,300
takes the best route available at that
time.

116
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,479
Upon reaching your phone the packets are reassembled according to their sequence number.

117
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,500
If it is the case that any packets fail to reach your phone and acknowledgement

118
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,140
is sent from your phone to resend the lost packets.

119
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,660
Now compare this with a postal network

120
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,300
with a good infrastructure, but the
customers do not follow the basic rules

121
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,460
regarding the destination addresses.

122
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,720
In this scenario letters won't be able to

123
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,280
reach the correct destination.

124
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,560
Similarly in the internet we use
something called protocols for the

125
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,560
management of this complex flow of data
packets.

126
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,400
The protocols set the rules for

127
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:32,860
data packet conversion, attachment of the source and destination addresses to each packet

128
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:38,020
and the rules for routers etc for
different applications the protocols

129
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,579
used are different.

130
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:45,900
We hope this video has given you a good understanding about how the internet
works,

131
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,199
more specifically about the amazing journey of data packets

132
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,760
from the data center to your mobile phone.
