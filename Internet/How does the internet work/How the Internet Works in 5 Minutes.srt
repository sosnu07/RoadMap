1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:04,850
so how does the internet work most of us

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,830
know how to use the internet without

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,990
actually understanding how it works sort

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,240
of like electricity in your home you use

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,920
it every day but may not understand the

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,589
mechanics behind it and if the electric

7
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:17,360
grid is difficult to understand then the

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,270
internet must be impossible right wrong

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,000
in the next few minutes I'll put you in

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,320
the top 10 percent of people who

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,730
understand how the internet actually

12
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,730
works for security catalyst comm I'm

13
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,479
Aaron Titus whenever most people think

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,220
of the Internet this is what comes to

15
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,550
mind the Internet is not a bubble cloud

16
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,730
even in the new age of cloud computing

17
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,440
the whole fuzzy cloud picture was

18
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,880
created by people more concerned about

19
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,140
job security than education this is the

20
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,570
internet the Internet is a wire actually

21
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,330
buried in the ground it might be fiber

22
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,790
optics copper or occasionally beamed to

23
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,020
satellites or through cell phone

24
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,420
networks but the Internet is simply a

25
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,720
wire the Internet is useful because two

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,430
computers connected directly to this

27
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,010
wire can communicate a server is a

28
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,170
special computer connected directly to

29
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,660
the Internet and web pages are files on

30
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,020
that servers hard drive every server has

31
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,150
a unique Internet Protocol address or IP

32
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,240
address just like a postal address IP

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,120
addresses help computers find each other

34
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,930
but since seven 2.14 205 done 100 it

35
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,300
doesn't exactly roll off the tongue we

36
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,659
also give them names like google.com

37
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:34,659
facebook.com or security catalyst comm

38
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:36,800
so this is how it works

39
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,320
your computer at home is not a server

40
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,450
because it's not connected directly to

41
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,000
the Internet computers you and I use

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,010
everyday are called clients because

43
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,540
they're connected indirectly to the

44
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,190
Internet through an Internet service

45
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,590
provider here we'll pretend that this is

46
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,979
my home laptop and I'm using DSL now

47
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,180
let's pretend that I want to visit

48
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,000
aol.com which is coincidentally both a

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,810
server and an ISP I hop onto my laptop

50
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,720
with DSL go through my ISP onto the

51
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,989
internet and look at aol.com my computer

52
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:11,150
connects with AOL comm and I can look at

53
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,330
its web pages now let's say that I want

54
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,440
to send an email to

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,950
and Ruth and Ruth has AOL dial-up from

56
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,390
home and I've got a gmail account I log

57
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,000
on to gmail.com and compose a message to

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,130
Aunt Ruth's email address Aunt Ruth's at

59
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,240
aol.com

60
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,660
once I click send gmail.com since the

61
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,690
email to Al well calm the next day Aunt

62
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,300
Ruth dials into AOL servers and

63
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,690
retrieves the email whenever an email

64
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,790
picture or webpage travels across the

65
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,220
internet computers break the information

66
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,070
into smaller pieces called packets when

67
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,840
information reaches its destination the

68
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,460
packets are reassembled in their

69
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,680
original order to make a picture email

70
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,880
web page or tweet

71
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,880
okay so imagine you're at work sitting

72
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,410
next to your boss and you're both

73
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,200
surfing online your boss is doing market

74
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,940
research and you're updating your

75
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,520
Facebook profile you're both sending

76
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,310
packets back and forth over the Internet

77
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,900
but what's to keep your packets from

78
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,760
accidentally ending up on your boss's

79
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,150
screen that could be embarrassing the

80
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,520
solution to that problem is IP addresses

81
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,459
and routers everything connected

82
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,470
directly or indirectly to the Internet

83
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,350
has an IP address everything that

84
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,360
includes your computer servers cell

85
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,160
phones and all of the equipment in

86
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,250
between anywhere two or more parts of

87
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,200
the internet intersect there's a piece

88
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,110
of equipment called a router routers

89
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,940
direct your packets around the internet

90
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,950
helping each packet get one step closer

91
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,470
to its destination every time you visit

92
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,660
a website upwards of ten to fifteen

93
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,580
routers may help your packets find their

94
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,489
way to and from your computer imagine

95
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:56,680
each packet as a piece of candy wrapped

96
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,080
in several layers the first layer is

97
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,140
your computer's IP address your computer

98
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,820
sends the packet to the first router

99
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,209
which adds its own IP address each time

100
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:09,310
the packet reaches a new router another

101
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,140
layer is added until it reaches the

102
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,299
server then when the server sends back

103
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:14,200
information

104
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,209
it creates packets with an identical

105
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,399
wrapping as the packet makes its way

106
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,959
over the internet back to your computer

107
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,780
each router unwraps a layer to discover

108
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,700
where to send the packet next until it

109
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,500
reaches your computer and not your

110
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,100
bosses and that's how the internet works

111
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,290
in five minutes or less and you're now

112
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,060
easily in the top 10 percent of people

113
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,560
who understand the basics of the

114
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,750
Internet if you found this video helpful
