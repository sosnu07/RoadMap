1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,490
what's up Internet today I'm gonna be

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,400
explaining what is a domain name and a

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,560
little bit about how a domain name works

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,630
you're probably here because you're

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,210
looking to start a website or maybe

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,160
you're just sick of watching videos of

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,470
kids yodeling in Walmart and you want to

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,840
learn something new either way my name

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,609
is Dale and welcome to create a

10
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,119
pro-western so in the simplest terms a

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,699
domain name is just the address to your

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,060
website so think of the Internet as a

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,570
vast map full of avenues and streets and

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,180
turns everywhere and think of your

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,910
website as your house in order for

16
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,920
anyone to find their way to your house

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,890
even you you'll need an address this

18
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,340
address is your domain name every

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,579
website has an IP and an IP is just a

20
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,949
seemingly random string of numbers so

21
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,079
when you register and purchase a domain

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,390
name it's almost like saving your home

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,820
address as home into your phone

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,789
it gives that IP address a simple easy

25
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,489
to remember name that anyone can type in

26
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,530
and get to your website this is because

27
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,720
it would be really difficult to remember

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,880
a random string of numbers every time

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,400
you want to go to apple.com

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,100
or night B or whatever it may be let's

31
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,920
say create a pro website com you can

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,299
remember that it's simple

33
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:28,110
rather than 6 6 . 1 3 4 . 2 9 9 I made

34
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,759
that up like how are you supposed to buy

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,920
an Apple watch with that so let's say

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,140
that you type in create a pro website

37
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,530
com whenever you hit enter your computer

38
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,450
sends a request to a bunch of servers

39
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,049
that make up the DNS and DNS just stands

40
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,930
for domain name system this domain name

41
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,750
system looks up the correct IP address

42
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,000
and just points your computer into the

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,280
right direction all within less than a

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,200
millisecond wow the Internet is a

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,200
magical place so that's what a domain

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,210
name is and a little bit about how it

47
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,369
works so if you'd like to purchase a

48
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:03,159
domain name

49
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,319
because you're gonna say start a new

50
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,479
website for your new business or a

51
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:10,269
portfolio or a blog or whatever it might

52
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:12,580
be I will put a link in the description

53
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,620
