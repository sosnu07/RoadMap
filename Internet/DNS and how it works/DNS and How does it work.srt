00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,599
hey everyone this is kamran and today

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,679
we're going to talk about the dns

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,799
or the domain name system dns is one of

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,559
those topics that anyone who develops

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:09,360
for the web

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,360
should know about it is a broad topic so

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,040
i'm going to divide this lesson into two

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:13,759
videos

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,360
in this lesson we're going to talk about

10
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,359
what is dns and how does it work

11
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,880
and the next one is going to be about

12
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,119
the dns records and how to debug the

13
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,560
issues with the help of dig

14
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,160
traced out and nslookup so what is dns

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,080
before we learn about the dns we need to

16
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,359
know what is internet

17
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,119
and before we learn about the internet

18
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,120
we need to know what is a network

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,200
network is just a group of computers and

20
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,880
other devices that are connected to each

21
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,719
other so for example if at your home you

22
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,120
have a printer you have a laptop and a

23
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,760
desktop

24
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,280
and all of these are connected to each

25
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,360
other these are all forming a network

26
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,760
moving on we have internet which is a

27
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
global network of networks

28
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,680
so for example if you at your home have

29
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,680
a home network and then your friend has

30
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,199
a home network of his own

31
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,960
and then he has another friend which has

32
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,640
a home network and all these networks

33
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,559
are grouped together to form a bigger

34
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:01,199
network

35
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,359
so internet is similar to that just a

36
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,600
global network of all the networks

37
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,119
now on the internet if you have to

38
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,880
communicate with some other device you

39
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,240
need to know how to find it

40
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,000
to find the device on the internet we

41
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,240
use something called the ip address

42
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,240
so each device on the internet has an ip

43
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,759
address which has a numeric

44
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,400
format and it looks like this and it is

45
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,000
used to locate that device on the

46
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,880
internet

47
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,720
and same goes for the websites that you

48
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,000
visit on the internet

49
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,320
the ip address of the server where that

50
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,680
website is hosted

51
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,280
is used to load the website in the

52
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,439
browser but how does it work because we

53
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,200
normally put the domain name in the

54
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,840
browser

55
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,759
how is the browser able to find the ip

56
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,119
address of the server

57
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,200
the answer to that is the browser uses

58
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,880
something called a dns

59
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,640
which helps us get the ip address from

60
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,920
the domain name so

61
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,880
the browser sends the dns the domain

62
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,360
name

63
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,840
and it gets back the ip address and once

64
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,920
it has the ip address it can go on the

65
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,560
network

66
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,960
and hop from different routers till it

67
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,840
reaches the

68
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,840
server and then it loads the website

69
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,240
from there

70
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,159
okay now that we've got the high level

71
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,680
understanding of the internet

72
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,318
and how it works let's look at the dns

73
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,639
and see how it works internally

74
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,879
so first of all we have the browser so

75
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,480
the user enters the website in the

76
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,120
browser

77
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,959
and tries to open it as we know that the

78
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,440
first step is dns resolution so the

79
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,520
browser needs to find the ip address

80
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
of the website first of all the browser

81
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,879
will look at the cache

82
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,800
and see if it has the ip address of the

83
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
website from any previous visits if it

84
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,400
doesn't find it there then it will look

85
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
at the dns cache and see if we have the

86
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,720
ip address there and if it is also not

87
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,879
there then it will look at the host file

88
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,800
to see if we have a mapping from the

89
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
domain name to the ip address

90
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,879
defined there if it is able to find the

91
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,879
ip address in any of these places

92
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,959
it will load the website from there and

93
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,720
it will not do any of the next steps

94
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,480
that we will mention now if it is not

95
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,239
able to find the ip address in any of

96
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,280
these caches

97
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,200
or the host file the next step is the

98
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,519
recursive dns servers this is normally

99
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,560
your isp

100
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,640
or internet services provider which

101
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,319
provides you the internet now it doesn't

102
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,519
know anything about the

103
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,000
domain name but it has the caches from

104
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,200
any previous visits

105
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,040
so it is possible that some other user

106
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,120
might have visited the same website

107
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,360
and might have the cached ip address if

108
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,040
it is able to find the cache type

109
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,720
address it will just return the ip

110
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,560
address from here and it does not have

111
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,760
to go to the next step

112
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,760
and if the ip address is not found here

113
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,599
then the next step is the root dns

114
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,239
servers

115
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,319
now root dns servers also do not have

116
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,920
the ip address information for the

117
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,799
domain name

118
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,480
but they have the information about the

119
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,879
tld or the top level domain

120
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,560
so for example if you're looking for

121
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,040
google.com so the tld

122
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,920
or the top level domain is dot com so it

123
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,560
knows

124
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
who might have the information about all

125
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,239
the dot com domains so it will just

126
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,159
return the information about the

127
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,799
tld server now the tld server also

128
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,000
doesn't know where the domain

129
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,959
is but it knows the final place where

130
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:53,360
might

131
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,159
the domain information be which is the

132
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,840
authoritative name server

133
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,920
so it will just return the information

134
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,680
about the authoritative name server and

135
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,360
the request will go to the authoritative

136
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,080
name server

137
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,159
get the ip address of the domain name

138
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,120
from there

139
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,640
the ip address will then come to the

140
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,239
recursive dns servers

141
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,920
where it might be cached and then it

142
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,239
will be sent to the user's computer

143
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,840
and then to the browser and then the

144
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,600
browser will request the website

145
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,399
servers and get the website from there

146
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,519
and this is how the

147
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,280
ip address of the website is found on

148
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,919
the internet with the help of dns

149
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,919
and that's it for our lesson i hope you

150
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,759
enjoyed it if you have any questions or

151
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,479
comments

152
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,000
leave them below and i will see you in

153
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,880
the next lesson
