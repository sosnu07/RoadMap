00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,839
hey guys my name is christian taylor

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,280
welcome back to crailer made where i

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,720
like to talk about all things

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,279
branding marketing and entrepreneurship

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,120
when building your first wordpress

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,840
website

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,559
you probably googled wordpress hosts or

8
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,080
how to install wordpress

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,440
and went down the rabbit trail of

10
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,600
exploring the most popular wordpress

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,400
hosts

12
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,920
if you're new to wordpress you are

13
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,080
likely confused by the wide variety of

14
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,880
hosting packages offered by companies

15
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,119
what is shared hosting can it run

16
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,000
wordpress

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,039
and what is a vps some hosts say they're

18
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:31,760
managed

19
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,239
some are unmanaged what's the difference

20
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,840
today i'll be breaking down what you

21
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,520
need to know about different types of

22
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,480
web hosting

23
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,879
so first let's start with shared hosting

24
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,800
shared hosting explains itself in the

25
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,360
name

26
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,360
you're sharing your hosting with others

27
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,800
but what does that mean

28
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,879
is this a good thing or a bad thing well

29
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,719
in my video where i explain the basics

30
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,840
of web hosting

31
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,399
i talk about web hosting being a server

32
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,440
or souped up

33
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,239
computer where your website files live

34
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,000
when someone types in your domain name

35
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,920
their computer points to the server

36
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,239
downloads the website files and displays

37
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,040
the website

38
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,799
so with shared web hosting you're

39
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,799
sharing a server with many people

40
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,720
it really varies based on the web host

41
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,159
but there may be as many as

42
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,960
hundreds or thousands of other websites

43
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,280
hosted on the same server as yours

44
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,880
the pros to this are that you can get

45
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,200
hosting at a crazy affordable cost

46
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,040
anywhere from two dollars a month to ten

47
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,960
dollars a month is pretty reasonable for

48
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,799
basic shared hosting it's the most

49
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,880
economic way to start a website and it's

50
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,640
where i recommend you start unless you

51
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,680
know you're going to get a

52
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,079
huge surge in traffic on your website

53
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,000
and that's the downside of shared

54
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,799
hosting

55
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,280
resources your website is on a server

56
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,240
with potentially

57
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,560
thousands of other websites and everyone

58
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,920
is sharing the same ram

59
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,000
and processor it's not always as bad as

60
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,079
it sounds because hosting platforms have

61
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,720
a way to compartmentalize resources and

62
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,360
make sure that there's not a hog website

63
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,680
using up all the power but it's still a

64
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,560
limitation

65
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,799
if you're getting 1 100th of the ram and

66
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,320
processor of a server

67
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,159
your website may load quickly for a

68
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,600
light or medium load

69
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,520
but say you're an ecommerce store and

70
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,439
you get a spike in traffic from a black

71
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,560
friday sale

72
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,639
these types of scenarios are not handled

73
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,160
well by shared hosting

74
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,000
the other downside of shared hosting is

75
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
being affected by denial of service

76
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,640
attacks

77
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,800
or other forms of malicious attacks that

78
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,680
can happen on

79
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,080
other users websites i want to be clear

80
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,800
here and say

81
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,720
just because someone else's site on your

82
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,080
server gets hacked

83
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,720
doesn't mean your site is hacked again

84
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,640
shared hosting platforms separate and

85
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
compartmentalized hosting accounts to

86
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,080
stop that from happening

87
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,760
but your site can be affected by

88
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
specialized forms of attacks like a

89
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,360
denial of service attack

90
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,840
on another website think of it this way

91
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,360
say you're in an office building with a

92
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,640
hundred cubicles

93
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
if one cubicle gets breached you're

94
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,720
still safe but if the power to the

95
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,360
entire office building gets compromised

96
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,519
everyone in the office is affected even

97
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,120
if the hacker didn't even know your

98
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,319
website existed

99
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,840
and they were just trying to mess with

100
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,080
someone else's it could cause your site

101
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,319
to go down if they do a certain type of

102
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:02,800
attack

103
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,280
that affects the server and not just the

104
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,000
website

105
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,239
so is shared hosting really worth it

106
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,080
well again if you're running a casual

107
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,000
blog or small business website

108
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
i think shared hosting is absolutely

109
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,000
worth it it's readily available

110
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,319
offered by almost every hosting company

111
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,680
and highly affordable

112
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,120
if you're watching this video and you

113
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,879
just want to build your first wordpress

114
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,599
website

115
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,200
i think you're good to start out with

116
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,599
shared hosting alright so what is vps

117
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,000
hosting a vps is a virtual private

118
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,720
server

119
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,200
now this is a bit of a wacky concept a

120
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,959
vps acts like its own

121
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,519
isolated server but it's shared with

122
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,519
other virtual private servers on

123
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,480
a single physical hardware server you're

124
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,200
probably like

125
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,120
wait a minute so shared hosting is

126
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,560
shared on a server and

127
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
a vps is shared too what's the

128
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,200
difference well a vps takes the level of

129
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,120
separation a step further

130
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,080
giving you dedicated resources x amount

131
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,720
of ram

132
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,439
x shares of a cpu and a virtual server

133
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,000
that's your

134
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,720
own oftentimes with cheap shared hosting

135
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,360
companies

136
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,760
oversell their servers this means that

137
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,599
they put more websites on the server

138
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,519
than it can theoretically handle

139
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,439
and they bank on x percentage of

140
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,760
customers never setting up their website

141
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,159
or

142
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,238
setting up a website that never gets any

143
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,880
traffic this usually works out but if

144
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
their load is higher than expected

145
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,000
say on black friday everyone's website

146
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,720
suffers

147
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,880
this really comes down to the web host

148
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,360
and with premium hosts like wp engine

149
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,400
and flywheel

150
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,040
you won't face this problem with a vps

151
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,840
while you're still

152
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,919
sharing a physical server you're

153
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,840
guaranteed the resources you're paying

154
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,320
for

155
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
it's a virtual computer that requires

156
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,680
its own set of ram

157
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,479
cpu and disk space and no one else can

158
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,280
pull from that

159
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,919
it has to be reserved for you think of

160
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:48,800
it like this

161
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,040
with shared hosting you have a folder on

162
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,880
a computer with hundreds of other

163
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,440
folders

164
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,840
on the same computer with a virtual

165
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,880
private server

166
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,040
you have a virtual computer all to

167
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,759
yourself so a vps can have any operating

168
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,320
system

169
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,800
windows or linux and you can change any

170
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,080
setting and configure

171
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,400
anything exactly how you want this

172
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,479
effectively beats the two downsides to

173
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,600
shared hosting

174
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,440
you can have significantly more server

175
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,280
resources than with a shared hosting

176
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,000
account

177
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,400
and vpss are known for being easily

178
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,440
scalable

179
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,280
you could go from four gigs of ram to

180
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
eight gigs of ram with a click

181
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,400
upgrade storage etc with a quality vps

182
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:26,880
host

183
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,479
everything is modular and can be

184
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,720
upgraded and downgraded with a snap

185
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,800
so this time on black friday if your

186
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
server is unable to handle the load

187
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,400
click a button upgrade to a more

188
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,320
powerful vps for the day

189
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,400
that can handle the surge in traffic and

190
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,440
then when you're done

191
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,320
simply downgrade to the vps you had it's

192
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,039
really cool

193
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,120
furthermore with the vps someone would

194
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,880
have to target your virtual private

195
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,440
server with a hack specifically

196
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,120
even if someone took down another

197
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,880
virtual private server that's on the

198
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,440
same

199
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,240
physical server as yours your server

200
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,319
cannot be affected since it's treated as

201
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,400
an entirely separate computer with

202
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,160
shared hosting there are sometimes a few

203
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,759
different plans you can upgrade to

204
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,400
offering vague promises like double the

205
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,120
speed

206
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,120
but what does that really mean your

207
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,280
server resource customization options

208
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,360
are highly limited with basic shared

209
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,919
hosting

210
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,400
since a vps is your own private server

211
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,000
you get to make the rules for the most

212
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,400
part you can host as many websites as

213
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,199
you like

214
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,280
host email although i don't recommend

215
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,360
that the sky is the limit

216
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,960
with shared hosting there are often

217
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,120
limits to how many sql databases you can

218
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,680
create

219
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
or how many domain names you can connect

220
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,199
to one hosting account

221
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,919
but with the vps it's all yours and you

222
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,759
can do whatever you want with it

223
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,840
of course it's your job to find a vps

224
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,440
with the appropriate power for your

225
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,160
needs

226
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,280
and if you're going to put a large

227
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,120
amount of websites on it you'll want to

228
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,440
pay for a beefier vps that can handle

229
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,160
the load

230
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,720
so a vps is indefinitely more powerful

231
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,039
but it does come with big downsides

232
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,440
a vps on its own is a massive headache

233
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,680
to manage if you aren't a tech geek

234
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,000
i consider myself tech savvy but it's a

235
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,080
challenge for me to manage a traditional

236
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
vps by itself

237
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,560
i say traditional vps by itself because

238
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,080
this is where the concept of

239
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,960
managed hosting comes in a managed vps

240
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,880
host like cloudways will allow you to

241
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,199
have your own vps from a cloud provider

242
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,000
you choose

243
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,919
but they handle all the technical side

244
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,240
of getting it set up and configuring it

245
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,840
you have a clean and simple management

246
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,840
panel so you can just add a new website

247
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
to the server whenever you want

248
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,080
typically with a vps you'd have to get

249
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
your hands dirty and mess with a command

250
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,639
line

251
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,960
but with a managed vps you just have a

252
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,319
convenient panel like

253
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,400
shared hosting but you get to leverage

254
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,680
the big power advantages of a vps

255
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,520
obviously this is a lot more expensive

256
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,680
than an unmanaged vps but it can

257
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,520
definitely be worth it depending on your

258
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,400
needs

259
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,319
so the last main kind of hosting is

260
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,120
dedicated hosting or a dedicated server

261
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,440
and this one's pretty easy to understand

262
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,599
take all the advantages of a vps

263
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,360
but now visualize yourself having an

264
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,319
entire physical server to yourself

265
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,360
picture a server in your head got it you

266
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,319
see it

267
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,199
yeah that's yours all of it the entire

268
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:09,680
thing

269
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,759
it's only your stuff hosted on it and

270
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,879
nothing else

271
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,039
in my honest opinion a dedicated server

272
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,080
is in some ways

273
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,800
worse than a vps sure it's theoretically

274
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,560
the most powerful option because you're

275
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,400
not sharing it with anyone

276
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,319
but you can't easily upgrade it or

277
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,240
downgrade it like a vps

278
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,639
it's also insanely expensive and i

279
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,080
personally would stay away from a

280
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,199
dedicated server

281
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,120
unless you already knew what it was

282
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,799
before watching this video

283
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,559
there's really no reason to use it

284
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,320
unless you're a giant company and you

285
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,640
need multiple dedicated servers working

286
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
together to host your files

287
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,159
but then again if you know what a

288
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,320
dedicated server is you probably know

289
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,360
what aws

290
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,839
azure and digitalocean are too and

291
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,920
modular cloud computing is looking like

292
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,399
a far

293
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,560
better choice for very advanced hosting

294
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,040
projects instead of dedicated servers

295
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,360
alright so that was a lot to process but

296
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,720
i want to give some examples of

297
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,640
real-world hosting packages and

298
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,720
categorize where they fall to help you

299
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,640
better understand different types of web

300
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,200
hosting

301
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,279
let's look at dreamhost here we can see

302
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,480
that they actually offer

303
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
every kind of hosting we talked about

304
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,320
we've got standard shared hosting which

305
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,200
is affordable

306
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,800
comes with basic support and a

307
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,519
management panel we have managed vps

308
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,080
hosting

309
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,480
managed wordpress hosting and dedicated

310
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,519
server hosting

311
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,200
now wait a minute what is managed

312
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,279
wordpress hosting is it shared

313
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,839
is it a vps well in this case it's

314
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:30,399
shared

315
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,320
but it's premium managed wordpress

316
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,600
hosting think

317
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,200
dreampress wp engine flywheel and kinsta

318
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,040
these hosts go above and beyond to

319
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,959
provide a reliable and fast

320
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,600
experience using isolated containers

321
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,360
similar to a vps

322
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,440
in other words with a premium managed

323
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,480
wordpress host

324
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,240
it is shared but you're not going to

325
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,560
face the major throttling problems

326
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,800
or other issues you get with economy

327
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,920
shared hosting

328
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
since it's managed you can expect great

329
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,480
support access to staging environments

330
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:00,800
and

331
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,279
automatic backups with one-click restore

332
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,360
if money is no factor for you this is

333
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,519
arguably the best wordpress hosting you

334
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,200
can get for your site when it comes to

335
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,040
the different types of web hosting

336
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,480
i think you need to step back and look

337
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,240
at the features and practicality

338
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,800
first over the category is the hosting

339
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,640
within your budget do you require

340
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,320
hands-on support or are you

341
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,000
okay with poking around and figuring

342
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,399
things out do you need development tools

343
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,399
like a staging environment and automatic

344
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,600
daily backups

345
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,680
focus on these first and the features

346
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,200
will help you narrow down whether you

347
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,480
need shared hosting

348
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,279
vps hosting and managed or unmanaged

349
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,079
hosting

350
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,600
if you'd like to see me create a video

351
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,279
talking about what to look for in a web

352
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:39,760
host

353
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,680
drop a comment below if you're starting

354
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,760
out i'd recommend basic shared hosting

355
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,680
from namecheap or dreamhost

356
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,519
if you need more power or features like

357
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,120
a staging environment or high-end

358
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,000
support

359
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,399
go with flywheel or wp engine if you

360
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,160
just have one website

361
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
if you host several wordpress websites

362
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,000
and are looking for the ultimate managed

363
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,160
vps host where you can host as many

364
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,600
websites as you'd like

365
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,839
i recommend trying cloudways i

366
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,680
personally use wp engine

367
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,079
and cloudways i have my highest traffic

368
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,240
website hosted on wp engine

369
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,399
and i have a two gigabyte digitalocean

370
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,320
server with cloudways that hosts the

371
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,680
rest of my websites

372
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,399
including all of my trailer media sites

373
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,480
so what type of hosting do you use

374
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,680
i'd love to know your thoughts in the

375
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,360
