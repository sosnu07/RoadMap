1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,860
welcome back I hope you had a good

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,710
holiday if you celebrate Thanksgiving I

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,529
have a pretty decent one had a weird

4
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:10,170
sore throat problem but I'm starting to

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,700
recover from it and feel a lot better

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,019
now so that's good

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,020
and I actually didn't have a big turkey

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,660
I am half 11 knees so he actually had

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,330
some middle-eastern food we had Kibby

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,289
which is a minced meat dish mixed with

11
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,000
bulgur which is actually quite good I

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,789
enjoyed it a lot but today we're going

13
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,189
to be talking about hosting your

14
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,649
projects and where are some good options

15
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,059
if you want to save money and deploy on

16
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,760
a budget so the general way to save

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,520
money when deploying things is to spend

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,219
more time setting them up yourself

19
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:49,440
rather than paying a service to set up

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,750
stuff for you now the first thing that

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,640
we're going to look at is cloud

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,860
providers now they kind of break the

23
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,020
rule because they do this thing where

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,920
they have a juicy free tier so AWS has

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,019
it where they offer a bunch of free

26
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,950
stuff for their services for 12 months

27
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,439
Azure has a similar thing where for 12

28
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,299
months they offer you free services and

29
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,460
they also throw in a two hundred dollar

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,150
credit for 30 days now AWS I believe

31
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,530
also gives you like a hundred dollar

32
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,229
credit you can get somewhere and all of

33
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,840
these cloud providers have random

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,430
promotions where they're throwing money

35
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,790
at you also Google cloud has one where

36
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,939
you just get straight $300 for 12 months

37
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,159
and then they also have some always free

38
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,590
stuff so these guys are kind of cheating

39
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,570
because they don't actually charge you

40
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,500
anything usually until after a year of

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,770
using them or until you pass their free

42
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,320
usage which usually doesn't happen right

43
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,159
away so there's this illusion of value

44
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,070
that you're able to not spend anything

45
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,790
and get a ton of services and so this is

46
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,640
the exception to the rule where you're

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,920
able to leverage some of this stuff

48
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,079
short term and that's the key thing

49
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,199
these are great options if you want to

50
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,080
set up a project that you think maybe

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,860
take a year to

52
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,420
set up or something you're gonna have a

53
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,330
low traffic at first and then after that

54
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,700
you see yourself growing the project and

55
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,610
starting to get more users and hopefully

56
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,950
generating some revenue through your

57
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,710
service and then you can pay for some of

58
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,380
the higher prices that the cloud

59
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,960
services are going to charge because

60
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,820
that is the way they function they try

61
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,980
to hook you in with the free services

62
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,709
you get set up and using them you're

63
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,780
using their services so it's harder to

64
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,209
migrate away and use a different service

65
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:46,890
it's easier to just stay where you are

66
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,070
so when the free tier is up you continue

67
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,770
using them and you start using their

68
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,900
paid versions of whatever you're getting

69
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,209
from free before and this is where it

70
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:59,100
starts to get more expensive than some

71
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,080
of the other options but with that said

72
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,660
I still think this is a super legit way

73
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,270
to go especially if you see yourself in

74
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,160
the short term having a smaller budget

75
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,500
but in the long term having a more

76
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,660
flexible or larger budget to work with

77
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,060
especially because it's always gonna be

78
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,810
cheaper to hire Google cloud to manage

79
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,180
for example your database or your

80
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,880
servers than it is to hire a human to

81
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,650
monitor and make sure those things are

82
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,959
working and so if you want to start

83
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,299
cheap and then get some of the services

84
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:31,739
that are gonna be handled for you I

85
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,530
think a cloud free tier and then paying

86
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,260
later is a great option to go with now

87
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,459
there's some other things to consider

88
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,010
when choosing a cloud provider - there's

89
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,380
two things that I do not like about them

90
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,709
the first is their complexity just to

91
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,950
setup and use so they have gone to the

92
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,900
point now where they are just supporting

93
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,750
so many use cases and so many different

94
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,000
services that their dashboards are

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,239
getting very very complex and they are

96
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,870
offering certificates to learn AWS or

97
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,360
you get certified to show that you

98
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,760
actually know how to use AWS now because

99
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,920
it is that complex and you actually put

100
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,049
on your resume that you are capable of

101
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:15,660
using AWS because it is getting to that

102
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,000
point where you really need to study it

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,190
to fully understand how it works and

104
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,959
make sure you're using it correctly and

105
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,940
so that really ties in with the second

106
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,919
thing you can really easily mess up and

107
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,389
the price

108
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:29,909
is not always super transparent it's

109
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:32,159
very easy to spin up a lot of different

110
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,770
services underneath the hood and then

111
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,870
all of a sudden you have a larger bill

112
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,150
than you were expecting so it's not

113
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,919
always clear how much you're going to be

114
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,199
spending when you actually start using

115
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,139
these cloud providers so once you've

116
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,389
decided you actually want to use a cloud

117
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,460
provider the next question is which one

118
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,229
should you use should you go with Google

119
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:56,999
Microsoft desert or Amazon's AWS now

120
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:59,610
this is a video and it's owned which one

121
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,680
should you choose and this is also just

122
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,199
not the only options Oracle has a cloud

123
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,659
these just happen to be the biggest ones

124
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:08,699
and I would probably recommend just

125
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,590
starting with AWS because this happens

126
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,080
to be the one that is used the most so

127
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,120
it's gonna carry over this skill set to

128
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,979
know a BWS is actually getting pretty

129
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,400
important and a lot of different jobs

130
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,659
need it and you'll use it in a lot of

131
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:24,330
different places but I'm gonna leave an

132
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,960
in-depth comparison for a separate video

133
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,849
okay so that is option number one go

134
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:32,520
with a cloud and take advantage of their

135
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,580
generous free tears now option number

136
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,159
two is one that I personally use and

137
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,379
it's where we get more into setting

138
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:43,139
stuff up ourselves and I'm gonna split

139
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,770
this into four categories number one is

140
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,949
hosting our database number two is

141
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,800
hosting our server number three is

142
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,360
hosting our front-end

143
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,389
so server more are back inside and then

144
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:00,029
our front-end side our website and then

145
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:03,629
lastly what about user uploaded images

146
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,759
now I'm choosing that because that's a

147
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,800
very common thing that you usually have

148
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,960
in your application and something you

149
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,610
need to think about and affects how you

150
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,029
host so starting with the database this

151
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:17,460
is what I would not recommend using if

152
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,289
you're on a budget and the reason for

153
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:21,689
that is it gets very expensive very

154
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:24,120
quickly and that is these hosted

155
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,069
database options that are getting more

156
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:29,009
popular so one example this is M lap

157
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:31,349
where they will host a MongoDB database

158
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,379
for you and you can see here it costs

159
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:37,289
$15 per gigabyte and that is very

160
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:39,209
expensive a gigabyte is not a lot of

161
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:41,760
data but if you take it to the

162
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,730
why this is so much it makes sense and

163
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,830
that's because you're not just getting a

164
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,810
database you are getting backups

165
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,700
included for you you're getting support

166
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,980
free transfer analytics hardware costs

167
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,930
and maybe some other stuff thrown in

168
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,300
there but it's something where if your

169
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,760
database crashes you don't have to go in

170
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,770
there and handle that stuff they have a

171
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,169
team that is making sure your database

172
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:05,820
is up and running and functioning

173
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,490
correctly and so that can be really nice

174
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,370
but it can be really expensive so

175
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,410
another option and that's similar to

176
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,230
this is with Redis labs where they are

177
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,620
hosting a Redis instance for you and

178
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,419
here you can see it is twenty two

179
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,510
dollars a month for one gigabyte and for

180
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,070
five of your bytes is one hundred and

181
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,600
five dollars a month so very quickly

182
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,540
with not a lot of gigs it gets very

183
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,600
pricey but again they are doing extra

184
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,729
stuff for you and again depending on

185
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:38,430
your plan you get more stuff and so if

186
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,830
you need these extra services maybe you

187
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,810
want to consider these things but not

188
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,240
everybody needs all of these things and

189
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,280
it's one of those things where for a lot

190
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,220
of sites if your database crashes it's

191
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,380
okay to have an hour of downtime where

192
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,940
you go in there and you fix it yourself

193
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,340
that usually isn't too problematic for

194
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,950
most sites it's just the fact that you

195
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,110
don't really need 99 percent uptime all

196
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,570
the time it's a very rare case that your

197
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,280
database crashes at least it should be

198
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,720
if it isn't you may want to have to

199
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
consider switching your database or

200
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,160
changing something up so what I like to

201
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,760
do instead is host the database and a

202
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,520
virtual private server so for example

203
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,979
digitalocean is a company that sells

204
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,530
these so is a vulture and there is a ton

205
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,419
like this where basically you get a

206
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,490
little computer and you can install

207
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,990
whatever software you want in there and

208
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,720
host projects and so it's also very

209
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,740
flexible so not only can I stick MongoDB

210
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,750
but I can also stick Redis on there and

211
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,820
so I'm not limited to just hosting a

212
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,370
single database on there but I can host

213
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,140
multiple databases and I can also

214
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,780
include my back-end server so personally

215
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,270
what I will do for small projects is I

216
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,150
will setup a single virtual machine

217
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,760
which I will stick my database and I'll

218
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,140
also stick my server on

219
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,540
so they're close together now again this

220
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,820
may not be optimal in all cases because

221
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,970
if my database crashes so does my entire

222
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,250
application but a lot of cases this is

223
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,800
an acceptable amount of risk and I think

224
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,779
is a great option if you are doing a

225
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:13,110
small to medium-sized project and you

226
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,390
see using this or building this over a

227
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,790
long term because it is a cheaper price

228
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,589
and if you want some of these other

229
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:22,290
services along with just you know

230
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,480
hosting your database you will need to

231
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,730
set these up yourself which can be a pro

232
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,250
or a con the pro is you can set up

233
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,750
however you like and you get a ton of

234
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,610
flexibility with it you get to choose

235
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,620
the analytic tool that you use or you

236
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,630
get to pick the way that you're backing

237
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,880
up your database so for example backups

238
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,920
were something that I really want it so

239
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,019
what I do is I have a cron job which

240
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,420
runs every day and it backs up the

241
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,529
database and saves the database to s3 so

242
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:53,250
on AWS on Amazon and so I have backups

243
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,560
made every day and make sure I don't

244
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,720
lose any data still and to give you a

245
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,190
little insight into I actually like to

246
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,019
use to manage everything on the virtual

247
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:02,880
machine I like this open source software

248
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,880
called dokku which works very similar to

249
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,010
Heroku where you just push up your code

250
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,670
and add in some database add-ons and you

251
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,890
just let it handle the rest for you you

252
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,720
know if they touch nginx or mapping

253
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,329
subdomains and it's very easy to get

254
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:20,519
let's encrypt set up so you have htps

255
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,579
and so I actually have and you can run

256
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:25,079
several different servers from the

257
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:27,750
single virtual machine and so I have

258
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,810
Postgres running in there and Redis and

259
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,510
then also my back-end server and so

260
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,550
being able to handle all those things in

261
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,370
a single box or single server is pre

262
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,769
cost efficient so how much do these

263
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:42,930
virtual private readings actually cost

264
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,630
well here is the pricing table for

265
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,690
vulture so you can see it starts at 250

266
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,690
a month and it goes up from there and it

267
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,640
really just depends on how much memory

268
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,149
and how much CPU you need or you want

269
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:00,329
now it's not just about those two things

270
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:02,160
though and so that's one of the things

271
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,949
that I naively would compare before so

272
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:06,930
for example we can look at the price

273
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,520
table here and the price table

274
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,740
Oshin and we can see they're pretty

275
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,330
comparable at least with the amount of

276
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,600
memory and CPUs and transferred discs

277
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,890
and that sort of thing that you get

278
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,380
compared to each other but that doesn't

279
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,310
mean you're gonna get similar

280
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,710
performance and the underlying software

281
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,290
that vulture and digitalocean use could

282
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,450
be totally different and so to be honest

283
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,630
with you I have no idea which VPS

284
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,490
provider you should choose I'm

285
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,920
personally trying out a couple different

286
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,270
ones right now that try to figuring out

287
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,520
which one I like the best I'm playing

288
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,590
around with this one called SSD notes

289
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,620
but I have no idea if they're any good

290
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,930
but here is the thing that I think is

291
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,410
the true test is to just do benchmarks

292
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,510
and to see which one benchmarks the best

293
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,940
is probably the best way to choose

294
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,430
between these and so one place that does

295
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,800
this there's this Josh tronic blog that

296
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,160
compares them and so it gives you a nice

297
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,780
side-by-side of these five providers and

298
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,360
they'll actually go into CPU and some

299
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,610
other things memory and compare the

300
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,710
speeds of them and see which one you're

301
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,690
actually getting you know you may pay

302
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,270
$10 for each one of these which ones

303
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,280
actually give you the most performance

304
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,600
best memory or best CP or etc another

305
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,890
place that I found that was pretty

306
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,870
interesting was called VPS benchmarks

307
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,480
where you could actually compare two

308
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,600
different VPS and their speeds and

309
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,520
whatnot so if you go to compare maybe

310
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,350
providers where was I could actually

311
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,200
like show suit compare VPS providers and

312
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,390
so I could click vulture and I could

313
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,260
click Google cloud compute or compute

314
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,540
engine I mean we could actually compare

315
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,480
these and get a breakdown of their both

316
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,660
their pricing and also in each category

317
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,310
they kind of rate them on performance

318
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,960
and whatnot and you can even get into

319
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,900
more fine-grain things down here on the

320
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,760
performance at different levels so if

321
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,990
you're into this thing and you want to

322
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,120
dive into this you could send you could

323
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,770
consider looking at these different

324
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,180
benchmarks and maybe that'll help you

325
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,610
pick but in this particular category I

326
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,410
have no idea which one is the best

327
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,690
vulture seems to consistently be one

328
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,090
that across several different benchmarks

329
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:22,880
performs

330
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,070
pretty well and I've used it and it's

331
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,080
been a positive experience so it's one I

332
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,590
feel confident recommending starting

333
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,780
with at least but there may be some

334
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,370
better ones out there so let me know if

335
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,990
you have a favorite on what you actually

336
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,930
choose for this but in general

337
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,130
price-wise they're pretty comparative

338
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,590
and they offer about the same CPU about

339
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,420
the same memory so it really comes down

340
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,640
to the performance of each one of what

341
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,620
they're giving you okay so the VPS will

342
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,010
handle your back-end in your database

343
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,620
now for your front-end this only really

344
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,690
matters if you're not doing server-side

345
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,850
rendering so if you're doing jam stack

346
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,630
or you have a static website aka if

347
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,520
you're using create react app using

348
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,500
Gatsby something like that I actually

349
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,810
like to host it on net liffe I if you

350
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,910
are doing server-side rendering aka

351
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,820
you're using Django Ruby on Rails using

352
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,940
next yes something like that where you

353
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,920
are actually you know rendering the

354
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,200
pages from your server then you can

355
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,390
actually just stick it with your VPS and

356
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,880
you can do it there so this is for

357
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,190
static sites I like to split them off

358
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,680
and not render them in the VPS because

359
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,320
you can get a really nice free tier from

360
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,030
net liffe I and so it will take some

361
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,190
load off of your server if you can serve

362
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:40,700
stack files here so what I'll do is I

363
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,620
believe it's up to a hundred gigabytes

364
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,520
of bandwidth that you get for actually

365
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,110
being able to host here and so that will

366
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,510
last you a very long time and static

367
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,750
websites are so easy to like migrate who

368
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,210
you're hosting with it's very easy to if

369
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,940
you reach over the hundred gigs which

370
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,620
will give you give you for free it's

371
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,850
very easy to switch if you want to go

372
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,250
somewhere else but you may even want to

373
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,750
stick with metal if I I personally just

374
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,190
really like the experience with

375
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,810
deploying here it's very easy it's very

376
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,240
quick and I like it a lot so this is

377
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,080
where I would go just totally free for

378
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,550
front-end at your website if it's static

379
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,270
so lastly let's talk about handling user

380
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,540
uploaded images so I'm not talking about

381
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,670
you know you have some assets on your

382
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,710
landing page I'm talking about your

383
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,080
Twitter your Facebook your some place

384
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,880
where you want to handle the user

385
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,800
uploading stuff and displaying their

386
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,600
custom images and they could upload them

387
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,160
anytime and so you want to be able to

388
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,800
handle that so I want to first talk

389
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,020
about the approach that I like the best

390
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,090
and then we're talking about how you

391
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,460
can't accomplish that approach so this

392
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,660
is the one that I really like and that

393
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,200
is to store wherever they upload store

394
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,060
it at that size so if they upload an

395
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,600
image that happens to be 900 by 900 you

396
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,420
save it as 900 by 900 now the thing is

397
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,580
your website may need it a different

398
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,620
size or may need some different settings

399
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,810
on the image so what you'll do is when

400
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,030
you request the image you will give it

401
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,920
some parameters for example the width

402
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,260
and height that you need or maybe you

403
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,150
need this width right and so what we'll

404
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:20,610
do is the service will resize it get to

405
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,410
the width that you want it on the fly

406
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,230
then it will cache it and then it'll

407
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,330
give you the image so this is something

408
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,980
where the first time it may take

409
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,600
slightly longer because it needs to

410
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,970
dynamically create the image at the do

411
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,770
size on the server and it's going to

412
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,890
give you the image so the nice part of

413
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,140
this approach is you have the original

414
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,500
image at 900 by 900 and then you can

415
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,280
resize it to whatever you want right so

416
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,720
as your requirements for the website

417
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,210
change or maybe you need different sizes

418
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,670
in different places it's very easy to be

419
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,040
able to just change the URL parameter

420
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,870
you don't have to go generating a bunch

421
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,240
of files ahead of time the right size

422
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,880
that you want now I've tried doing this

423
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,140
approach myself in putting this logic on

424
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,810
digital ocean or vulture or one of those

425
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:13,079
places but to be honest it is just a

426
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,819
headache to try to do well it's not so

427
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,619
much it's a headache to actually set up

428
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,680
it's more of a headache to try to get

429
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,569
performant and I was never able to get

430
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,790
to a speed that was quite happy with

431
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,369
I even tried seeking cloud fair in front

432
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:29,130
but even then when image is loaded it

433
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,080
was just a lot slower than some of the

434
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,570
other options so I would actually

435
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,850
recommend in this case at least I

436
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,590
haven't had much success try and do it

437
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,280
myself

438
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,980
this is where I actually do like using a

439
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,340
service to handle dynamically resizing

440
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,490
images for me so there are two places

441
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,140
that I know of that can

442
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,200
do this image thing for you so the first

443
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,170
one is cloud nari and they are great on

444
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,420
a budget at least they're free tier

445
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,360
handles quite a bit of images so you pay

446
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,420
nothing upfront similar to how with the

447
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,940
cloud provider has a nice free tier and

448
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,270
then maybe you'll be paying more later

449
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,890
but the hard thing I have with this

450
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,590
service is or the hard thing to tell

451
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,050
from this is they give you monthly

452
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,360
credits so for example the free tier you

453
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,880
get 25 and just a side note I really

454
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,470
hate when these companies create their

455
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,450
own little currency like this it's very

456
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,910
hard to try to figure out how the

457
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,720
currency maps to actual spending but

458
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,120
anyway you get 25 credits which then

459
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,400
used to a hundred or a thousand

460
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,520
transformations one Giga storage or one

461
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,070
gig of net viewing bandwidth you get the

462
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,990
gist so what the credits could go to

463
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,070
some amount of image processing so it's

464
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,900
really hard to tell when exactly you

465
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,570
would hit threshold to be paying $89 a

466
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,660
month to be honest I'm not quite sure

467
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,330
when a project you really need or how

468
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,280
much usage you'd have before you reach

469
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,260
the threshold because it's kind of hard

470
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,760
to calculate ahead of time how much your

471
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,220
image usage is going to be so that's my

472
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,750
main beef with clouding area I think

473
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,640
it's really nice I think the service is

474
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,140
good but I personally haven't used them

475
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,970
a ton because I feel like their pricing

476
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,030
is a little less transparent than the

477
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,910
second option which is image X so with

478
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,970
this company how it works is you pay $3

479
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,840
per thousand images and then 8 cents per

480
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,900
gigabyte of bandwidth and then you can

481
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,360
transform the image with the property's

482
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,680
height width and then they have a

483
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,300
thousand other transformations you can

484
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,000
do as me as many times as you want it

485
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,420
doesn't cost extra so I have a very hard

486
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,450
time trying to compare this pricing take

487
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,980
Loudoun Aires and trying to figure out

488
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,440
well with this many credits how much is

489
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,770
it going to be on image X I'm not really

490
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,140
sure so if someone's done the math do

491
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,380
let me know but my gut instinct says

492
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,720
once you pass the free tier of cloud and

493
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,730
airy I feel like image X is going to be

494
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,480
less money but to be asked I haven't

495
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,700
no idea but I think both of them are

496
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,049
pretty good options I've really enjoyed

497
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:07,970
image X as a service I thought it's

498
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,040
worked out really great but they don't

499
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,350
have a free tier cloud Andheri does so

500
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,330
maybe cloud nare just strictly wins and

501
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,100
maybe it's even cheaper at the plus tier

502
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,780
that was the case I probably should

503
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,850
probably switch the cloud nari but I am

504
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,620
personally using image X right now

505
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,929
liking them but these are two really

506
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:26,770
good options for handling your images

507
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,500
but there you go in conclusion I like to

508
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,130
use cloud services if I am doing a

509
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,260
project where in the long term I see it

510
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,880
making a lot of money but maybe in the

511
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,110
short term I want to take advantage of

512
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,080
the free tier otherwise I like putting

513
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,080
my back-end my server on a virtual

514
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,360
machine for example using vulture and

515
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,990
then serving my website on net low Phi

516
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,419
and hosting my images on either cloud

517
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,750
Neri or on image X also one thing I

518
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,940
totally forgot to mention Culinaire will

519
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,000
actually host your images image X you

520
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,440
don't doesn't actually host your images

521
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,059
I forgot that's like a huge difference

522
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:07,580
actually so I actually have my images

523
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,490
stored on Google Cloud storage and then

524
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,010
image X is kind of a cache layer in

525
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,990
front of it so that's big thing to know

526
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,900
difference between the two but yeah I've

527
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,929
liked image X that's just a heads up so

528
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:22,400
there you go that is how you can deploy

529
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,540
on a budget

530
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,129
you
