00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,639
hi i'm tony messer from picaweb and in

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:03,439
this video

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,279
i'm going to explain everything you need

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,120
to know about web hosting

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,880
at the end of this video you'll have all

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,559
the information you need to make an

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,599
informed decision

8
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,679
when you buy a hosting service sound

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:14,639
like a plan

10
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,210
great let's get started

11
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:22,230
[Music]

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,519
okay so the basics hosting is the home

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,480
of your website

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,000
if you're on a website you'll need

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,160
somewhere to host it that's exactly

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,000
what web hosting is now there are

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,520
different types of

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,040
hosting service you've got shared

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,440
hosting reseller hosting

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,680
virtual private servers or vps and

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,280
dedicated servers

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,879
but we're going to be looking at shared

23
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,640
hosting in this video because that's the

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,520
most popular

25
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,760
and affordable type of hosting so

26
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,280
hosting is basically

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,760
the computer and network infrastructure

28
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,760
that keeps your website available

29
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,000
across the internet it also provides

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,640
other key services like email for you

31
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,879
so how does it all work well it all

32
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,039
starts with a server which is basically

33
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,000
a powerful

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,400
computer which is stored in a highly

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,360
secure

36
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,360
purpose-built multi-million pound

37
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,760
facility called a data center

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,560
the data center provides the network and

39
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,080
power connectivity

40
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,360
with temperature control backup systems

41
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,520
fire suppression and high levels of

42
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,960
physical security

43
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,360
security is also important at the server

44
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,680
level so the servers are actually built

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,240
with dual components for critical

46
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,960
components

47
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,360
things like hard drives and power supply

48
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,320
units

49
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,560
and the reason for this is to make sure

50
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,400
that your website is available

51
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,280
at all times so when you order a hosting

52
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,000
service

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,320
what you're actually purchasing is the

54
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,399
physical disk space on the server

55
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,920
as well as the bandwidth which is the

56
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,439
network connection

57
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,040
for the server and you'll often see

58
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,280
hosting advertised in terms of disk

59
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,960
space and bandwidth so you might see for

60
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,439
example

61
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,240
five gig five gigabytes of disk space

62
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,360
and 100 gigabytes

63
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,799
of bandwidth per month so the disk space

64
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,680
that covers

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,520
your website and all of your files

66
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,598
including key files things like your

67
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,560
emails

68
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,480
and the monthly bandwidth allowance this

69
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,400
is the amount of traffic that comes in

70
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,760
and out of your website and your hosting

71
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,840
space so that will usually most of it

72
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,360
will be made up by email

73
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,160
traffic in and out but also things like

74
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,680
people visiting your website and when

75
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,640
you actually publish

76
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,200
your website files in order to manage

77
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,160
your web hosting

78
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,879
you'll need access to a user-friendly

79
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,800
interface called a control panel

80
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,239
the one of the most popular control

81
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,239
panels is called cpanel

82
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,120
and this allows you to manage key areas

83
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,640
of your hosting things like setting up

84
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,840
email addresses

85
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,480
managing domains and forwarding managing

86
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,440
databases

87
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,680
that kind of thing and this shields you

88
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,120
basically from any of the sort of

89
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,840
technical

90
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,760
aspects of the hosting if you want to

91
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,959
build your own website

92
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,040
you can use a tool like website builder

93
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,080
which is included

94
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,640
and this basically allows non-technical

95
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,360
users

96
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,080
to build and maintain a website and it

97
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
uses templates pre-made templates so you

98
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,120
just add your own

99
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,599
text and images and then can publish it

100
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,120
for more advanced users or maybe you've

101
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,319
got a web designer

102
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,200
then there are more advanced tools and

103
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,040
applications which are included

104
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,000
for free so so you can sort of manage

105
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,680
databases and also use

106
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,360
other tools to build your website and

107
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,120
these kind of tools these applications

108
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,599
these include popular content management

109
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,120
systems like wordpress

110
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,280
as well as more advanced e-commerce

111
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,319
tools like

112
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,480
prestashop and magento so you can start

113
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,599
selling online

114
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,519
other security features are things like

115
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,879
anti-spam software

116
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,040
and data backup and these ensure the

117
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,120
integrity of your email

118
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,920
and your data if if you're with one

119
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,680
hosting company and you want to transfer

120
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,120
to another hosting company that's very

121
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,879
straightforward this is a process

122
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,200
called migration and basically your

123
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,720
files are copied from your current

124
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,680
hosting to your new hosting service

125
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,879
there are just a couple of

126
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,560
small changes that need to be made to

127
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,560
your domains and name server settings

128
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,799
for that process to be fully completed

129
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,640
okay so there you have it that's your

130
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,439
